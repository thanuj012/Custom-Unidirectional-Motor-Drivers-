# Custom-Unidirectional-Motor-Drivers-

This repository contains custom motor driver designs and firmware for robotics projects.  
It includes hardware schematics, LTspice simulations, and microcontroller code for DC motor control.

## Structure
- `hardware/` → LTspice schematics, PCB files
- `firmware/` → ESP32, STM32, Arduino code
- `examples/` → Example robot/motor test projects
- `docs/` → Diagrams, block schematics, documentation

## Features
- PWM speed control
- Forward/Reverse direction
- Supports ESP32, Arduino, STM32
- Example quadcopters, path finder bots

## License
- **MIT** (for firmware/code)  
- **CERN-OHL-S v2** (for hardware schematics/PCB)
